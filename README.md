# Chelsea Date

I want to ask Chelsea out on a date. Her favorite color is bergundy and her favorite animals are sloths.

I used DALL-E to generate the initial images and Runway ML to convert it to a video.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/austin-starks/NexusGenAI.git`
2. [Download MongoDB community edition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/). Turn on MongoDB. It is recommended that you turn it on in the background so that you can close the tab.
3. Go to the directory: `cd chelsea-date`
4. Install the dependencies: `npm run build`

## Turning on the system

To turn on the client and server:

1. Open two terminal windows.
2. In one window, turn on the client: `cd client; npm run dev`
3. In the other window, turn on the server: `cd app; npm start`
